## A time saver
Every semester students have to apply for their next semester courses.
Most students like to look up their professors on Ratemyprofessor.com to read the reviews of previous students. This involves copying the professors name and pasting it into the rate my professor website. I decided to build a chrome extension that automatically displays the rate my professor score next each professor's name. The score is also a clickable link that takes the user to that professor's rate my professor page.

Many classmates are using it and it has been very helpful for them!
